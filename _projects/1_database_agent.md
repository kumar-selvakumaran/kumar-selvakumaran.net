This project implements a ReAct {% cite yao2023react %} database agent in **LangChain**. The agent engages in a feedback loop with the database, using **multi-hop reasoning** to iteratively query and refine its understanding. Through this process, it leverages **in-context learning** to build knowledge about the database schema and contents until it has enough information to answer complex user questions. Finally, it responds with both the natural-language answer and the exact SQL commands it executed to obtain the result. The project was deployed as a [hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KumarSel/database_agent)
