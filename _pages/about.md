Iâ€™m Kumar Selvakumaran â€” a bright-eyed, curious, and driven AI enthusiast who loves turning ideas into robust, precise systems. I thrive at the junction of research and product, iterating fast, learning faster, and caring deeply about responsibility, reliability, and useful outcomes.  

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a **Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University** (GPA: 3.77/4.0), with coursework in Verifiable Machine Learning, Humanâ€“Computer Interaction, Computer Vision, and Unsupervised ML. My focus lies in building **reproducible, explainable, and high-performance AI workflows** that balance rigor with real-world usability.  

Iâ€™ve interned across industries â€” from **Norfolk Southern**, where I engineered GPU-accelerated agentic RAG systems and multimodal pipelines, to **Inflohealth**, where I scaled radiology-report retrieval with biomedical transformers, and **Sentient.io & Juhomi**, where I optimized computer vision microservices and co-developed an AI-powered retail analytics platform.  

Beyond internships, my projects span **multi-agent database systems, robust neural networks, and semantic product search**, while my publications address **transformer-based classification, explainable object detection, and AR in education**.  

I value **rigor over hype, clarity over noise, and measurable impact over vanity metrics**. Iâ€™m drawn to workflows kind to both humans and machines, and I aspire to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and responsible, scalable AI products.
